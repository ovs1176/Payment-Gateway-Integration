        22% of the total population in India (around 270 crores) live in poverty. “What exactly is poverty?”, 
         Poverty means living in conditions of where a person doesn’t have basic needs like proper food, water or shelter.
        The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little...
        Saving our planet, lifting people out of poverty, advancing economic growth... these are one and the same fight. We must connect the dots between climate change, water scarcity, energy shortages, global health, food security and women empowerment. 
        Solutions to one problem must be solutions for all.
        We need to steer clear of this poverty of ambition, where people want to drive fancy cars and wear nice clothes and live in nice apartments but don't want to work hard to accomplish these things. Everyone should try to realize their full potential.
        Our small help can nourish someones life,Lets help them ......

        In India, 22% of people are considered to be poor. "Exactly what is poverty? "Poverty" is the state of not
        having access to necessities such adequate food, water, or shelter. Therefore, we are offering a platform to
        help these folks rise and lead better lives. The true measure of our success is not how much more we give to
        those who already have plenty, but rather how much we give to those who lack. Lifting people out of poverty,
        promoting economic growth, protecting the environment... These two battles are one and the same. Connecting the
        linkages between energy constraints, water scarcity, climate change, global health, food security, and women's
        empowerment is crucial.
        There must be universal solutions to all problems.

        We need to avoid this lack of ambition, where individuals want to live in good homes, drive expensive cars, and
        dress nicely, but don't want to put in the effort to get these things. Everyone ought to make an effort to reach
        their maximum potential.
